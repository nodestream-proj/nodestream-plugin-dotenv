# Nodestream Dotenv Plugin

This plugin allows you to load environment variables from a `.env` file into your nodestream application.

## Installation

```bash
pip install nodestream-plugin-dotenv
```

## Usage

By default, the plugin will look for a `.env` file in the current working directory. You can specify a different path by setting the `NODESTREAM_DOTENV_PATH` environment variable.

For more information on how to use the `.env` file, see the [python-dotenv](https://github.com/theskumar/python-dotenv#file-format) documentation.
